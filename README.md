The first part of the homework has been runned locally in Leonardo's machine. It was about gathering the dataset through some scraping scripts, so following the guidelines we drained the links and then downloaded the HTML and parsed them, targeting some specific information. All the methods implied in this first part are in the **scraper.py** file, and in the *stuff* folder we can find **final_dataset.csv**, a dataset we build with the required information in order to deal with more practical operations.
